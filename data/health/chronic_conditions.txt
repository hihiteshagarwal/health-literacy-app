Understanding Diabetes
A Comprehensive Guide for Seniors in Singapore
Introduction
Diabetes is a significant health concern in Singapore, especially among our elderly population. Singapore has one of the highest diabetes rates in developed countries, with nearly 1 in 3 Singaporeans at risk of developing diabetes in their lifetime. As we age, our risk factors increase, but with proper knowledge and care, diabetes can be effectively managed. This guide aims to provide you with comprehensive information about diabetes to help you better understand and manage this condition.
What is Diabetes?
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most of the food you eat is broken down into glucose (sugar) and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar rises, it signals your pancreas to release insulin, which acts as a key to let the blood sugar into your body's cells for use as energy.
If you have diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use the insulin it makes as well as it should. When there isn't enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream, which over time can cause serious health problems such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.
Types of Diabetes
Type 1 Diabetes:
* The body does not produce insulin
* Usually diagnosed in children and young adults
* Requires insulin therapy for survival
* Not preventable with current knowledge
* Less common in the elderly population
Type 2 Diabetes:
* The body doesn't use insulin properly (insulin resistance)
* Most common form of diabetes in Singapore, especially among elderly
* Often develops gradually over years
* Can often be managed with lifestyle changes and medication
* Strongly linked to obesity and sedentary lifestyle
Prediabetes:
* Blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes
* Serves as an important warning sign
* Can often be reversed with lifestyle changes
Recognizing the Symptoms
Diabetes symptoms can sometimes be subtle, particularly in elderly individuals. Being aware of these symptoms is crucial for early detection:
Common Symptoms:
* Increased thirst and frequent urination: The excess sugar in your bloodstream causes fluid to be pulled from your tissues
* Extreme hunger: Despite eating, you may feel hungry because your tissues aren't getting enough glucose for energy
* Unexplained weight loss: Despite eating more than usual to relieve hunger
* Fatigue: Your cells are deprived of sugar, main source of energy
* Blurred vision: High blood sugar levels can cause fluid to be pulled from your lenses
Symptoms Particularly Common in Elderly:
* Subtle or absent symptoms: Many elderly people may have minimal or no obvious symptoms
* Cognitive changes: Confusion, difficulty concentrating
* Balance problems or falls: Due to neuropathy or vision changes
* Slow wound healing: Particularly on the feet
* Recurrent infections: Especially urinary tract or skin infections
* Dehydration: Often mistaken for other conditions
When to Seek Medical Care:
* If you experience multiple symptoms associated with diabetes
* For routine screening if you're over 40 (as recommended in Singapore)
* Immediately if you experience extreme thirst, frequent urination, and unexplained weight loss
Risk Factors Relevant to Singapore's Elderly Population
Several factors increase your risk of developing diabetes:
Non-modifiable Risk Factors:
* Age: Risk increases with age, particularly after 45
* Family history: Having parents or siblings with diabetes
* Ethnicity: In Singapore, Indians have higher rates of diabetes, followed by Malays and Chinese
Modifiable Risk Factors:
* Overweight or obesity: Particularly central obesity (excess weight around waist)
* Physical inactivity: Common problem as we age
* Poor diet: High in refined carbohydrates, sugars, and processed foods
* Hypertension (High blood pressure): Common among Singapore's elderly
* High cholesterol levels: Particularly high triglycerides and low HDL ("good") cholesterol
* History of gestational diabetes: Increases future risk
* Prediabetes: Indicates you're on the path to diabetes
Diagnosis and Medical Assessment
If your doctor suspects diabetes or during routine screening, several tests may be conducted:
Diagnostic Tests:
* Fasting Plasma Glucose Test: Measures blood sugar after fasting for at least 8 hours
* Oral Glucose Tolerance Test: Measures blood sugar before and after drinking a sweet liquid
* HbA1c Test: Reflects average blood sugar over the past 2-3 months, no fasting required
* Random Blood Sugar Test: Can be done at any time
Diagnostic Criteria in Singapore:
* Diabetes:
   * Fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L OR
   * 2-hour plasma glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L during OGTT OR
   * HbA1c ≥6.5% OR
   * Random plasma glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L with symptoms
* Prediabetes:
   * Fasting plasma glucose 6.1-6.9 mmol/L OR
   * 2-hour plasma glucose 7.8-11.0 mmol/L OR
   * HbA1c 6.0-6.4%

Understanding Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)
A Comprehensive Guide for Seniors in Singapore
Introduction
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is often called the "silent killer" because it typically has no warning signs but can lead to serious health problems. In Singapore, hypertension affects approximately 24% of adults, with prevalence increasing significantly with age. Among those aged 60-69, nearly 50% have hypertension, and the percentage rises even higher in those above 70. This guide aims to provide elderly Singaporeans with comprehensive information about hypertension, its management, and how to maintain a good quality of life while living with this condition.
What is Hypertension?
Hypertension is a condition where the force of blood against your artery walls is consistently too high. Blood pressure is measured using two numbers:
                  * Systolic pressure (the top number): The pressure when your heart beats and pushes blood out
                  * Diastolic pressure (the bottom number): The pressure when your heart rests between beats
Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The following categories are used to classify blood pressure levels:
Category
	Systolic (mmHg)
	Diastolic (mmHg)
	Normal
	Less than 120
	Less than 80
	Elevated
	120-129
	Less than 80
	Hypertension Stage 1
	130-139
	80-89
	Hypertension Stage 2
	140 or higher
	90 or higher
	Hypertensive Crisis
	Higher than 180
	Higher than 120
	Types of Hypertension
Primary (Essential) Hypertension:
                  * Develops gradually over many years
                  * No identifiable cause
                  * Most common form, affecting about 90-95% of hypertensive patients
Secondary Hypertension:
                  * Results from an underlying condition
                  * Appears suddenly and causes higher blood pressure than primary hypertension
                  * Possible causes include:
                  * Kidney problems
                  * Adrenal gland tumors
                  * Thyroid problems
                  * Certain medications (NSAIDs, decongestants, some traditional medicines)
                  * Sleep apnea
Isolated Systolic Hypertension:
                  * Common in elderly
                  * Only the systolic pressure is high (≥140 mmHg)
                  * Diastolic pressure remains normal (<80 mmHg)
                  * Often caused by arterial stiffening due to aging
Recognizing the Symptoms
Hypertension is often called the "silent killer" because most people have no symptoms, even when blood pressure readings are dangerously high.
Possible Symptoms (usually only in severe cases):
                  * Headaches: Particularly at the back of the head in the morning
                  * Shortness of breath: During routine activities
                  * Nosebleeds: Unexplained and recurrent
                  * Visual changes: Blurred or double vision
                  * Dizziness or lightheadedness: Upon standing or during exertion
Symptoms Particularly Common in Elderly with Severe Hypertension:
                  * Confusion or cognitive changes: May be subtle
                  * Balance problems: Increasing risk of falls
                  * Sleep disturbances: Difficulty sleeping through the night
                  * Facial flushing: Redness in the face
                  * Blood in urine: May indicate kidney damage from long-standing hypertension
When to Seek Emergency Care:
                  * Blood pressure reading above 180/120 mmHg
                  * Severe headache with confusion
                  * Severe chest pain
                  * Difficulty breathing
                  * Visual disturbances
                  * Blood in the urine
                  * Seizure or loss of consciousness
Risk Factors Relevant to Singapore's Elderly Population
Several factors increase your risk of developing hypertension:
Non-modifiable Risk Factors:
                  * Age: Blood pressure typically increases with age, very common after 65
                  * Family history: Genetic predisposition to hypertension
                  * Ethnicity: In Singapore, Malays and Indians have higher prevalence than Chinese
Modifiable Risk Factors:

Understanding Hyperlipidemia (High Cholesterol)
A Comprehensive Guide for Seniors in Singapore
Introduction
Hyperlipidemia, commonly known as high cholesterol, is a prevalent condition among Singapore's elderly population. According to the National Health Survey, approximately 40% of Singaporeans aged 60 and above have high cholesterol. This condition often develops gradually with age and can significantly increase the risk of heart disease and stroke if left unmanaged. This guide aims to provide elderly Singaporeans with comprehensive information about hyperlipidemia, its management, and how to maintain heart health while living with this condition.
What is Hyperlipidemia?
Hyperlipidemia refers to elevated levels of lipids (fats) in the blood. These lipids include cholesterol and triglycerides, which are essential for normal body functioning but can cause health problems when present in excessive amounts.
Understanding Cholesterol and Triglycerides
Cholesterol Types:
                  * Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL): Often called "bad cholesterol," LDL can build up on the walls of your arteries, forming plaque that narrows arteries and restricts blood flow.
                  * High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL): Known as "good cholesterol," HDL helps remove LDL from your arteries by carrying it back to the liver for elimination.
                  * Total Cholesterol: The sum of your LDL, HDL, and other cholesterol components.
Triglycerides:
                  * A type of fat in your blood that your body uses for energy
                  * Can contribute to arterial narrowing when levels are too high
                  * Often elevated in people with diabetes, obesity, or who consume excess calories, especially from alcohol or sugars
Normal and Abnormal Cholesterol Levels
The following table shows desirable and concerning levels of blood lipids (measured in mmol/L in Singapore):
Total Cholesterol:
Desirable: <5.2
Borderline High: 5.2-6.1
High: ≥6.2
LDL Cholesterol:
Desirable: <3.4
Borderline High: 3.4-4.0
High: 4.1-4.8
Very High: ≥4.9
HDL Cholesterol:
Desirable: ≥1.0 (men)
Desirable: ≥1.3 (women)
Triglycerides:
Desirable: <1.7
Borderline High: 1.7-2.2
High: 2.3-5.6
Very High: ≥5.7
Note: For individuals with existing heart disease or diabetes, target LDL levels may be lower (<2.6 or even <1.8 mmol/L).
Types of Hyperlipidemia
Primary Hyperlipidemia:
                  * Genetic in origin
                  * Familial hypercholesterolemia is an inherited condition causing very high LDL levels
                  * Often appears early in life but may not be diagnosed until adulthood
Secondary Hyperlipidemia:
                  * Caused by other conditions or factors such as:
                  * Diabetes
                  * Obesity
                  * Kidney disease
                  * Hypothyroidism
                  * Certain medications (diuretics, beta-blockers, some antipsychotics)
                  * Excessive alcohol consumption
                  * Poor diet high in saturated and trans fats
Recognizing the Symptoms
Hyperlipidemia is often called a "silent condition" because it typically has no symptoms until complications develop. However, in some cases, particularly with very high levels, the following signs might be observed:
Possible Physical Signs:
                  * Xanthomas: Yellowish deposits of fat under the skin, often around the eyes or over tendons
                  * Xanthelasmas: Yellowish patches around the eyelids
                  * Corneal arcus: White or grayish ring around the cornea of the eye (more significant when occurring before age 50)
Symptoms of Associated Complications:
                  * Angina: Chest pain or discomfort, indicating heart disease
                  * Shortness of breath: May indicate heart problems
                  * Pain in legs while walking: Could signal peripheral artery disease
                  * Symptoms of stroke or mini-stroke: Sudden weakness, difficulty speaking, facial drooping
When to Seek Medical Care:
                  * For routine screening: Even without symptoms, adults over 40 should get regular cholesterol checks
                  * Immediately: If experiencing chest pain, stroke symptoms, or other acute cardiovascular symptoms
Risk Factors Relevant to Singapore's Elderly Population
Several factors increase your risk of developing hyperlipidemia:
Non-modifiable Risk Factors:
                  * Age: Cholesterol levels naturally rise with age
                  * Family history: Genetic predisposition to high cholesterol
                  * Ethnicity: In Singapore, Indians have slightly higher rates of dyslipidemia compared to Chinese and Malays
Modifiable Risk Factors:
                  * Diet high in saturated and trans fats: Common in many processed foods
                  * Physical inactivity: Common problem as we age
                  * Overweight or obesity: Particularly central obesity (excess weight around waist)
                  * Diabetes: Very common in Singapore, affecting about 1 in 9 adults
                  * Smoking: Damages blood vessels and lowers HDL
                  * Excessive alcohol consumption: Can raise triglycerides significantly
Diagnosis and Medical Assessment
Diagnosis of hyperlipidemia is through blood tests:
Diagnostic Process:
                  * Lipid Profile: Fasting blood test measuring:
                  * Total cholesterol
                  * LDL cholesterol
                  * HDL cholesterol
                  * Triglycerides
                  * Additional Tests: May include:
                  * Blood glucose test (to check for diabetes)
                  * Liver function tests
                  * Thyroid function tests (thyroid problems can affect cholesterol)
                  * Apolipoprotein B and A-1 (specialized tests for certain cases)
Screening Recommendations in Singapore:
                  * Adults over 40: Should have cholesterol checked at least once every 3 years
                  * Those with risk factors: More frequent testing (annually or as recommended)
                  * Screen for Life Programme: Subsidized screening for Singapore citizens
                  * Health Hub: Online portal with information on screening locations and subsidies

Understanding Coronary Heart Disease (Heart Attack)
A Comprehensive Guide for Seniors in Singapore
Introduction
Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains one of the leading causes of death in Singapore, particularly among our elderly population. As we age, our risk factors increase, but with proper knowledge and care, we can manage this condition effectively. This guide aims to provide you with comprehensive information about CHD, specifically focusing on heart attacks, to help you better understand and manage this condition.
What is Coronary Heart Disease?
Coronary heart disease occurs when the blood vessels (coronary arteries) that supply blood to your heart muscle become narrowed or blocked due to the buildup of fatty deposits called plaque. This process, known as atherosclerosis, develops over many years and can eventually lead to a heart attack when blood flow to a part of your heart is completely blocked.
Understanding Heart Attacks
A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, happens when blood flow to a part of your heart is blocked for a long enough time that part of the heart muscle is damaged or dies. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention.
Recognizing the Symptoms
Heart attack symptoms can vary among individuals, particularly between men and women, and may present differently in elderly patients. It's crucial to be aware of these symptoms:
Common Symptoms:
                  * Chest pain or discomfort: Often described as pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain in the center or left side of the chest. This might come and go, or persist for several minutes.
                  * Upper body discomfort: Pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or stomach.
                  * Shortness of breath: This may occur with or without chest discomfort.
                  * Cold sweat, nausea, or lightheadedness
Symptoms Particularly Common in Elderly:
                  * Unusual fatigue: Extreme tiredness that may last for days.
                  * Confusion or disorientation: Particularly in those with existing cognitive issues.
                  * Sleep disturbances: Trouble sleeping or increased fatigue.
                  * Digestive symptoms: Indigestion, nausea, or loss of appetite.
                  * Subtle symptoms: Sometimes elderly patients experience minimal symptoms or "silent heart attacks" with no obvious pain.
When to Seek Emergency Care (CALL 995 in Singapore):
                  * If you experience chest pain lasting more than a few minutes
                  * If you have other symptoms along with chest discomfort
                  * If you suspect you or someone else is having a heart attack
Risk Factors Relevant to Singapore's Elderly Population
Several factors increase your risk of developing CHD and experiencing a heart attack:
Non-modifiable Risk Factors:
                  * Age: Risk increases with age
                  * Family history: Genetic predisposition to heart disease
                  * Ethnicity: In Singapore, Indians have higher rates of CHD compared to Chinese and Malays
Modifiable Risk Factors:
                  * Hypertension (High blood pressure): Common among Singapore's elderly
                  * High cholesterol levels: Particularly LDL ("bad") cholesterol
                  * Diabetes: Singapore has one of the highest diabetes rates in developed countries
                  * Smoking: Even former smokers have elevated risk
                  * Physical inactivity: Common problem as we age
                  * Obesity: Particularly central obesity (excess weight around waist)
                  * Poor diet: High in saturated fats, sugar, and sodium
                  * Stress: Chronic stress contributes to heart disease
                  * Excessive alcohol consumption
Diagnosis and Medical Assessment
If your doctor suspects CHD or you've experienced a heart attack, several tests may be conducted:
Diagnostic Tests:
                  * Electrocardiogram (ECG): Records electrical activity of your heart
                  * Blood tests: To check for cardiac enzymes that indicate heart damage
                  * Echocardiogram: Uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart
